## Introduction

This wiki is an introduction to the different code bases used in our system. It will also cover the different installation procedures. The team uses **Ubuntu LTS 20.04** and **Python 3.8**. It is highly recommended to use this Ubuntu version on a dual boot or WSLg instance. The latter does require Windows 11.
