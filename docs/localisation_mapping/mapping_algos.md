# General

This document contains an overview of currently developed mapping modules / algorithms.

## FastMapping

This package implements FastMapping. This is basically the mapping part of FastSLAM. It can be seen as a FastSLAM algorithm with only a single particle with a likelyhood of 1 (so 100% accurate). Below you can find a scheme of how it works, but I would recommend you to read about FastSLAM in [Supported SLAM Packages](/localisation_mapping/slam/)
